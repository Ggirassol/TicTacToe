# TicTacToe Description

Tic-tac-toe is a simple two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a square on the grid, one using "X" and the other "O". The goal is to be the first to get three of your marks in a rowâ€”horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
